Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It's better to control repository by yourself than just rely on automatic 
updates made by Git. It is just a desire to keep order in local repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

A: Forking is a very useful tool to make a copy (or clone) of any public 
repository on GitHub in orfer to have a full access to the files in it 
including push. Remember, it works only inside GitHub and hence it's impossible 
to fork repository locally. Whereas clone works in between remote server and 
local machine as well as inside local machine. Branch is a special label on 
commit, which might be place in any commmit at any time to get a possibility to 
checkout this commit easily.
