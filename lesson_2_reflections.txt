Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: On creation of a new repository Git make a new hidden directory for this 
repository called .git. The reason why we need to do it is necessity to have 
a place for saving repository metadata, i.e. commits and the like.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area looks like a temporary warehouse for the files which should 
be commited in a short time. It might be quite useful to check the files before 
commit, especially if there are untracked files.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

A: Staging area is a pretty useful tool to make sure of commiting oly necessary 
files including logically grouped changes. Without a staging area it would be 
much more difficult to track unecessary change that should be included in a 
certain commit.
