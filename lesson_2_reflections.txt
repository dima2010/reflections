Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: On creation of a new repository Git make a new hidden directory for this 
repository called .git. The reason why we need to do it is necessity to have 
a place for saving repository metadata, i.e. commits and the like.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area looks like a temporary warehouse for the files which should 
be commited in a short time. It might be quite useful to check the files before 
commit, especially if there are untracked files.
